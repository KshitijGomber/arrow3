# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Arrow3 Aerospace Platform is a comprehensive e-commerce web application for drone sales and management. The platform features a dark-themed, modern landing page inspired by DJI's design, complete product catalog with detailed specifications, order management system, mock payment integration, and an admin panel for content management. The system will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, React, Node.js) and deployed on cloud platforms (Vercel for frontend, Render for backend). It will serve both customers looking to purchase drones and administrators managing the product catalog.

**Technical Configuration:**
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Free tier, tag: `project:arrow3-aerospace`)
- **Frontend Deployment**: Vercel
- **Backend Deployment**: Render
- **Payment System**: Mock payment portal (no real transactions, accepts any card details for demonstration)
